## About

Hello! I am a data scientist based in Sacramento, California with an interest in improving understanding of Earth system processes and stewarding ecosystems. My research focus is climate-informed modeling for water and ecosystem management with a particular emphasis on applied solutions in mitigating the impacts of hydroclimate variability. I enjoy exploring local ecosystems like the Eldorado National Forest and serve as a water quality monitor for the American River Conservancy, collecting hydrological data in the Cosumnes River Watershed by recording field measurements, documenting habitat conditions, and observing species including endangered and at risk species in the western Sierra river.

The <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/eldorado" target="_blank" style="text-decoration-line: none; color: #727272; font-weight: bold;">Eldorado National Forest</a> is located in the central Sierra Nevada within the ancestral and unceded territories of the Miwok, Washoe, and Nisenan peoples. Eldorado spans 793,652 acres ranging in elevation from 1,000 feet in the foothills to more than 10,000 feet above sea level and is crossed by the Mokelumne, Cosumnes, American, and Rubicon rivers. Woodland, chaparral, mixed conifer, true fir, and subalpine vegetation comprise the forest with major species including ponderosa pine, sugar pine, white fir, red fir, Douglas fir, incense cedar, black oak, and canyon live oak. The map highlights the forest boundary identified by the USDA-Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region. Source: US Forest Service.
