### About

Hello! I am a data scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory based in Sacramento, California with an interest in improving understanding of Earth system processes and restoring ecosystems. My research focus is climate-informed modeling for water and ecosystem management with a particular emphasis on applied solutions in mitigating the impacts of hydroclimate variability. I study Earth data analytics at the University of Colorado Boulder and hold a MS in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Colorado State University.
