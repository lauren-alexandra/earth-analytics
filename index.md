## About

Hello! I am a data scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory based in Sacramento, California with an interest in improving understanding of Earth system processes and restoring ecosystems. My research focus is climate-informed modeling for water and ecosystem management with a particular emphasis on applied solutions in mitigating the impacts of hydroclimate variability. I study Earth data analytics at the University of Colorado Boulder and hold a MS in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Colorado State University. I enjoy exploring my local riparian forest and serve as a water quality monitor for the American River Conservancy, collecting hydrological data in the Cosumnes River Watershed by recording field measurements, documenting habitat conditions, and observing species including endangered and at risk species in the western Sierra river.
