## Precipitation in the Sierra Nevada

[Lake Tahoe](https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/ltbmu/about-forest/about-area) was selected to highlight trends in Sierra Nevada precipitation. The mountain range functions as a collection of moisture islands. The range forms barriers to incoming weather systems so that air and moisture are lifted over them, condensing the moisture which falls as precipitation to build thick snowpacks. Given the high precipitation and low evapotranspiration, the [Sierra](https://www.fs.usda.gov/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr272/psw_gtr272_013.pdf) produces most of the runoff forming my state's water supply.

#### Data Description

The South Lake Tahoe [subset](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:US1CAED0035/detail) of the [Global Historical Climatology Network daily dataset](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html) contains observations obtained at a weather station positioned at 1,919.6 m elevation. The station monitors rain and melted snow (mm); snow, ice pellets, and hail (mm); and snow, ice pellets, and hail on the ground (mm).

#### Methods

The data was accessed from a National Centers for Environmental Information [API service](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/support/access-data-service-api-user-documentation) and queried for the precipitation data type, station, and date range of 01-01-2022 to 12-31-2023. This range was chosen to gather full water years for comparison; the station began observing precipitation in late 2021. The CSV data file was ingested using the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library and the date records were changed to pandas datetime objects. Using these datetimes, month, year, and season data were generated. Additionally, the precipitation data were converted from millimeters to inches.
Next the data was subset to precipitation, month, year, and season, and grouped by the average observed precipitation value. Some months contained sparse daily records and the averages identified reflect this limitation. Finally, visualization libraries [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) were used to plot and display the relationship between month and precipitation across annual groupings.

### High Year-to-Year Precipitation Variability

The Sierra Nevada mountains receive most of their precipitation during a short wet period consisting of fix to six [atmospheric river storms](https://www.noaa.gov/stories/what-are-atmospheric-rivers) on average with great annual variability. A difference of one to two major storms can ensure a normal versus a dry water year. The above graphs highlight the annual variance in precipitation with notable shifts in the early months when it is optimal for precipitation to fall as snow rather than rain, supporting longer streamflows later in the summer when demand is high. The majority of precipitation is expected between [December through February](https://oehha.ca.gov/climate-change/epic-2022/changes-climate/precipitation#:~:text=California%20receives%20about%2075%20percent,information%2C%20download%20the%20Precipitation%20chapter.), but [warmer temperatures](https://www.fs.usda.gov/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr272/psw_gtr272_013.pdf) influence whether or not precipitation falls as snow. 

Atmospheric rivers are often associated with [flood risk](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL088679) and are especially risky depending on when they occur. For instance, one of these events occurred in March 2023 (averaging 6 inches of precipitation) and in preparation for the event, the [City of South Lake Tahoe](https://sierranevadaalliance.org/city-of-south-lake-tahoe-urges-residents-to-prepare-for-impacts-of-rain-on-snow-event/) communicated the danger to local residents: "The potential of heavy rainfall across the region brings the threat of flooding and roof collapses. Flooding may occur as a result of rain on existing snow and ice on the ground, and streams and river basins that are already elevated after numerous storms." Atmospheric rivers are a natural component of Sierra hydrology and [provide about 60% of the state's developed water](https://sierranevada.ca.gov/what-we-do/#regionalChallenges), but they are expected to become more extreme under climate change with [projected precipitation](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD031554) increasing 25% on average. How the state and stewards of the Sierra Nevada respond to shifts in precipitation will largely shape California's future resiliency.
